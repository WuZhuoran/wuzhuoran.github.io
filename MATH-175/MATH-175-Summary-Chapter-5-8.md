* Outright purchase
pay the stock price in cash, receive ownership of the stock.

* Fully leveraged purchase
borrow the entire purchase price of the security.
  - Suppose borrow share price $S_0$,
  - agree to repay the borrowed  amount at time $T$.
  - the continuously compounded interest rate is r,
  - at time T you would owe $e^{r^T}$ per dollar borrowed, or $S_0 e^{r^T}$.
<br/>

* Prepaid forward contract
pay for the stock today and receive the stock at an agreed-upon  mature date.
  - you receive the stock at time T,
  - the price you pay is not necessarily the stock price.

* Forward contract
both pay for the stock and receive it at time T, with the time T price specified at time 0.

## prepaid forward contract:

### no dividend:
$F^P_{~0,~T~}=S_0$

### discounted present value:
* expected stock price at time $T$ is $E_0(S_T)$, $\alpha$ the expect return on the stock.
then the prepaid forward price is $F^P_{~0,T~}=E_0(S_T)e^{- \alpha T}$

* $E_0(S_T)= S_0 e^{\alpha T}$

### Arbitrage (free money)
happen when $F^P_{~0,~T~}>S_0$, should not take place in any situation.

### With Dividends:

* Discrete dividends:

> Quarterly continuously compounded rate is 2.5%, quarter dividend is 1.25$, stock cost 100$ today)
> 1 year prepaid forward contract for the stock costs:
<br/>
<br/>

* Continuous dividends:
 the annualized daily compounded dividend yield is
 daily dividend is

 > index is 125$ and the annualized daily compounded dividend yield is 3%.
 The daily dollar dividend is (0.03 + 365) x $125 = $0.01027

## Forward contract

* No dividend:
$F_{~0,~T~}=S_0 e^{rT}$, just future value

* Discrete dividends:

* Continuous dividends:

* Forward premium =$\frac{F_{0,T}}{S_0}$

A swap is a contract calling for an exchange of payments over time.

A single payment today for a **single** delivery of oil in the future is a **prepaid forward**.      
A single payment today to obtain **multiple** deliveries in the future is a **prepaid swap**.
