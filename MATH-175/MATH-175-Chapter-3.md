# Chapter 3 Annuities  

## 3.1 introduction:     
* **Annuity** is the series of payments made at specified intervals for a fixed or continent period.

## 3.2 Annuities - immediate, at the **end** of each payment period.      
present value of the basic annuity immediate lasting n period equals the sum of the present value of the $n$ end-of-period payments, $v(1) + v(2) + \ldots + v(n)$.
