# chapter 9 Production Functions

## Production Function:     
* A firm's Production Functions for a good $q$ is the **maximum** amount of the good that can be produced using alternative combinations of inputs     

* $q=f(x_a, ...,x_n)$

* Consider capital $k$, labor $l$, then $q=f(k,l)$

## Marginal Physical Product     

Additional output that can be produced by increasing by a small amount one of the input while holding other inputs constant.   
* Marginal Physical Product of capital $MP_k = \frac{\partial q}{\partial k}= \frac{\partial f}{\partial k}=f_k$     

* Marginal Physical Product of labor $MP_l = \frac{\partial q}{\partial l}= \frac{\partial f}{\partial l}=f_l$     
<br/>     

## Diminishing Marginal Productivity
* An input depends on how much of that input is used.

* Marginal Product **decreases**

$\frac{\partial MP_k}{\partial k}=\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial k^2}= f_{kk}=f_{11}<0$, $\frac{\partial MP_l}{\partial l}=\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial l^2}= f_{ll}=f_{22}<0$,    

## Average Physical Product     
An input also depends on how much of the other input is used.    

$AP_l=\frac{output}{labor input} = \frac{q}{l}=\frac{f(k,l)}{l}$     

* $AP_l$ depends on the amount of capital employed.   
* $AP_k$ depends on the amount of labor employed.     

**Example:**     

$q = f(k,l)=600k^2l^2-k^3l^3$     

Marginal Product of labor $= \frac{\partial q}{\partial l}= \frac{\partial f}{\partial l} = 1200k^2l-3k^3l^2$     

$k=10$         

$MP_l=120000l-3000l^2$      

$\frac{\partial MP_l}{\partial l} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial l^2} = 120000-6000l<0$     

$l>20$

when $k=10$, $max f(k,l)= max (600k^2l^2-k^3l^3) = max (60000l^2-1000l^3)$     

f.o.c $MP_l=0, 120000l-3000l^2=0$     

$l=40$     (max profits)     

$f(k,l)= 600k^2l^2-k^3l^3$  
$AP_l = \frac{f(k,l)}{l}= 600k^2l-k^3l^2$     
$k=10, 60000l-1000l^2$     

## Isoquant Maps:     
* shows the combinations of $k$ and $l$ that can be used to produce a given level of output $(q_0)$, meaning all $(k,l)$ such that $f(k,l) = q_0$     

### Marginal rate of technical substitution (RTS)
* RTS is diminishing for increasing inputs of labor.     

* $RTS(l ~ for ~ k) = - \frac{dk}{dl}, when ~(q=q_0)$     
<br/>     
<br/>
<br/>     

* Marginal rate of technical substitution rate (RTS):      
the rate at which capital can be substituted for labor while holding output constant along an isoquant.     

**Example:**     
$dq = qf(k,l) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial k} dk + \frac{\partial f}{\partial l} dl = MP_k dk + MP_l dl$     
$dq=0$      
$MP_k dk + MP_l dl = 0$, if stays on same isoquant map,     

$-\frac{dk}{dl}=\frac{MP_l}{MP_k}$     

## Return to Scale:     
* The effect of a proportional change in input and output.     

* $q=f(k,l)$, all inputs are multiplied by the same positive constant $t>1$, then      

effect ont output | return to scale     
 --- | ---   
$f(tk,tl) = tf(k,l)$ | Constant
$f(tk,tl) < tf(k,l)$ | Decreasing
$f(tk,tl) > tf(k,l)$ | Increasing

### Two factors:     
  - greater division os labor and specialization of function(divide complex jobs in simple tasks)     

  - because of monitoring and communication, loss in efficiency because management may become more difficult given the larger scale of the firm.     

###Constant return-to-scale production function     

* Homogeneous of degree one in inputs. $f(tk,tl)=t^1f(k,l)=tq$     

* Marginal Productivity functions are homogeneous of degree zero.(Derivative is one degree less than the function).     
  - Marginal Productivity of any input depends only on the ratio of capital and labor.     

  - RTS between $k,l$ depends only on the ratio of $k$ to $$, not the scale of operation.     

* the RTS will be the same on all isoquants (same shape and same space).     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     


* for $n$ inputs, $q=f(x_1,x_2,..., x_n)$, RTS is same as two inputs.     
<br/>     

**Example, marginal product for constant RTS**     

$MP_e=\frac{\partial f(k,l)}{\partial l} = g(k,l)$     

$g(\frac{k}{l}, \frac{l}{l})=(\frac{1}{e})^0 g(k,l)=g(k,l) = MP_l$          

$g(\frac{k}{l})=MP_l$     

## Elasticity of substitution:     
* Elasticity of substitution $\sigma$, measures how easy it is to substitute one input with a different one.     

* proportional change in $k/l$ relative to the proportional change in the RTS along an isoquant.     

* $\sigma$ is always positive because $k/l$ and RTS moves to same direction.

* $\sigma = \frac{d(k/l)}{dRTS}\frac{RTS}{k/l} = \frac{d ln(k/l)}{d ln RTS}$     

* RTS and $k/l$ will change as we move from point A to B.     
$\sigma$ is the ratio of these proportional changes.           
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     

$\sigma$ is high | a small change in RTS | &rarr; a large change in $k/l$| isoquant is linear
--- | --- | --- | ---
$\sigma$ is low| a large change in RTS | &rarr; a small  change in $k/l$ |isoquant is curved     

* if define the elasticity of substitution between two input to be proportional change in RTS, we need to hold output and the levels of other inputs constant.     

### Linear (Perfect Substitutes):
Given $q=f(k,l) = ak+bl$,      

1. $f(tk,tl) = atk+btl = t(ak+bl)= tq$ , &rarr; linear.        

2. - isoquant constant.
   - $-\sigma =$ ∞.     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>         

### Fix proportional, (perfect complements):     
Given $q= min(ak,bl), a,b >0$     

meaning capital and labor must always be used in a fixed ration.    

&rarr; $k/l = b/a$ is constant, $\sigma =0$    

&rarr; No substitution between labor and capital is possible, constant RTS.     

<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>         

### Cobb Douglas production function:     
Given $q= f(k,l) = Ak^al^b, where A, a, b >0$     
different any RTS,      

$f(tk,tl) = Atk^a tl^b = A t^{a+b} k^a l^b = t^{a+b} f(k, l)$

a+b=1 | constant return to scale
--- | ---
a+b>1 | Increasing return to scale
a+b<1 | Decreasing return to scale    
<br/>     


### CES production function:     
Given $q=f(k,l)=[k^p+l^p]$, where $p≤1, p≠0, \gamma >0$     
$-\gamma >1$ | increasing return to scale
--- | ---
$-\gamma <1$ | Decreasing  return to scale      

when $\gamma = 1$, $\sigma = \frac{1}{1- \rho}$

$-p = 1$ | linear production function     
--- | ---
$-p infinite | fixed proportions production function
$-p = 0 | Cobb Douglas
