# Chapter 10
Economic profits:

profit $\pi$ | total revenue - total coast
--- |  ---
Total Revenue| $pq=pf(k,l)$
total Costs| $C=wl+vk$
Economic profits | $\pi = pq-C$

`Cost minimization (for a fixed level of output):`

## Cost:
* **Explicit cost**:     
Wages paid to employees (financial payment, rent, buying equipment etc.), and the cost of raw materials.

* **Implicit cost**:     
opportunity cost of the entrepreneur not related to financial payment(time spent on the firm), capital used for production.

* **Opportunity Cost**:     
remuneration the input would receive in its best alternative employment.     

## Assumption:     
* two inputs $k$ and $l$:     
entrepreneurial costs are included in capital costs.     

* inputs are hires in perfectly competitive markets, firms are f=price taker in input markets, meaning that **price is  given**.     

## Cost minimizing input:     

### Compensated Factor demands:          

$TC = wl+vk$,      

&rarr; $k=-\frac{w}{v}l+\frac{TC}{v}$            

Given $min (wl+vk)$, such that $q^-=f(k,l)$         

&rarr;  $L =  wl+vk + \lambda(q^- -f(k,l))$     
solve for F.O.C:     

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial l} = w-\lambda \frac{\partial f}{\partial l}= 0$     

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial k} = v-\lambda \frac{\partial f}{\partial l}= 0$      
...     

&rarr; $\frac{w}{v} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial l} / \frac{\partial f}{\partial k}= RTS$     

**Compensated Factor demands:**      
$l^* = l^c (v, w, q^-)$,      
$k^* = k^c (v, w, q^-)$
<br/>     

### Example 2      

$q=f(k,l) = k^{\frac{1}{3}}l^{\frac{2}{3}}$     
Given $min (wl+vk)$, such that $q^-=k^{\frac{1}{3}}l^{\frac{2}{3}}$ &rarr;  $q^- -k^{\frac{1}{3}}l^{\frac{2}{3}}=0$   
<br/>     

&rarr;   $L =  wl+vk + \lambda(q^- -k^{\frac{1}{3}} l^{\frac{2}{3}})$     
Solve for F.O.C:
$\frac{\partial L}{\partial l} = w - \frac{1}{3} \lambda k^{\frac{1}{3}} l^{-\frac{1}{3}} = 0$      
...     

&rarr; $\frac{w}{v}= \frac{2}{3} k^{\frac{1}{3}} l^{-\frac{1}{3}} / \frac{1}{3} k^{-\frac{2}{3}} l^{\frac{2}{3}}$     

&there4; $l^* = (\frac{2v}{w})^{\frac{1}{3}} q^-$, $k^* = (\frac{2}{2v})^{\frac{2}{3}} q^-$.      

### Opitimal point $(k^* , l^* )$
* Given output $q_0$ , we want to find the least point in the isoquant.     
$k=-\frac{w}{v}l+\frac{Total ~ Cost}{v}$      
<br/>      
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     

### Lagrangian multiplier $\lambda$:     
how much the total cost would increase
if output $q_0$ would increase by a small amount.     

### Expansion Path:     
* Firm can determine the cost minimizing combinations of $k$ and $l$ for every level of output.     

* Set of combination of optimal amount of $k$ and $l$ is called expansion path.     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     

  - not have to be a straight line;      
  use of some input may increase faster than others, depends on the shape of the isoquants).      

  - not have to be upward sloping;     
  use of an input falls as output expands, that input is an **inferior input.**     

## Total Cost Function:    
* Substituting the compensated factor demand function in the total cost:     
$C=wl^c(w,vq)+ vk^c(w,v,q)$,      
&rarr; total cost function: $C=C(w,v,q)$     

* minimum cost to produce the given quantity $q$ with given $k$ and $l$.     

## Average Cost Function:     
Total cost function per unit of output: $AC(v,w,q)=\frac{C(w,v,q)}{q}$     

## Marginal Cost Function:     
compute the change in the total cost function for a small change in output priduced.     
$MC(w,v,q)= \frac{\partial C(w,v,q)}{\partial q}$     

### Example 2 continued:     
since we calculated that $l^* = (\frac{2v}{w})^{\frac{1}{3}} q^-$, $k^* = (\frac{2}{2v})^{\frac{2}{3}} q^-$.      

$C(w,v,q)= wl^* +vk^* = w(\frac{2v}{w})^{\frac{1}{3}} q^- + v(\frac{2}{2v})^{\frac{2}{3}} q^-$     

$= (2^{\frac{1}{3}}+2^{-\frac{2}{3}}) w^{\frac{2}{3}} v^{\frac{1}{3}} q$
<br/>      

&rarr; AC $= (2^{\frac{1}{3}}+2^{-\frac{2}{3}}) w^{\frac{2}{3}} v^{\frac{1}{3}}$
<br/>       

&rarr; MC $= (2^{\frac{1}{3}}+2^{-\frac{2}{3}}) w^{\frac{2}{3}} v^{\frac{1}{3}}$           
<br/>     

## Graphical analysis of Total Costs

### Constant return to scale production function     
* $k_1$ unit of capital and $l_1$ units of labor are the optimal choice to produce one unit of output, $C(q=1, v,w)=vk_1 + wl_1$     

* $k_m=mk_1, l_m=ml_1$ when product $m$ units.    

* optimal choice $\frac{w}{v} =RTS$, price did not change, RTS depends only on $k/l$
  - ratio $k_m/l_m = k_1/l_1$        
<br/>          
<br/>          
<br/>          
<br/>          

small business, just stared: total cost rises slowly     
constant return to scale, compensated amount of labor, specialization
firm becomes larger, total cost rises very fast, lack of management, too many poople to control.

<br/>          

AC: U shape,      
when MC $<$ AC, AC goes down    
when MC $>$ AC, AC goes up          
cross at the bottom at cost function ($min ~ AC$)     

**Example**     
$q=f(k,l)=min(ak,bl)$ &rarr; $ak=bl=q$     

$k^c (w, v, q) = \frac{q}{a}$ | $l^c (w, v, q) = \frac{q}{b}$
--- | ---

$C(w,v,q)=vk+vl$     
$C(w,v,q)=q(\frac{v}{a}+\frac{w}{b})$     

### Properties of the total cost function     

* Homogeneity, cost function is homogenious of degree one     

* Increasing in $q$      

* Non-decreasing in $v$ and $w$     

* Concave in input prices,
  - price of labor goes up, firm's optimal: firm will replace workers with capital.     
	(consequence. before everyone get money, after some get more, some get zero.)      

## Short run/ Long run Distinction

### Short run     
* Easier to hire (and fire )workers     
* Difficult to change the level of the capital stock     

1. Increase Production in Short run:
	- Difficult to acquire more capital
	- hire more workers and use existing capital more intensively     
	- not optimal level of amount of capital, cost of production is higher than in the long run.      

2. Fixed Capital $k_1$,
firm is free to vary its labor only, plug in $q=f(k,l)$     

$q=f(k,l)=k^{\frac{1}{2}} l^{\frac{1}{2}}$, with $min wl+vk$     
$k^{\frac{1}{2}} l^{\frac{1}{2}} = q^-$     
since $k=k^-$ constant,      
$q^- = k_-^{\frac{1}{2}} l^{\frac{1}{2}}$      
$l^* =(w,v,q^-, k^-)= \frac{q^2}{k^-}$     

3. Short run total cost $=(w,v,q^-,k^-) = wl^* +vk^- = w\frac{q^2}{k^-} +vk^-$     
* fixed cost: $vk^-$, cannot be change in short run     
* $wl^* ~$ variable costs     

4. Long run total cost $=(w,v,q^-)=2w^{\frac{1}{2}} v^{\frac{1}{2}} q^-$     
(choose capital as Zero, all costs varies)     
<br/>     

5. $k^-$ is fixed, so RTS can not be the ratio of input changing price.  
* tangent cannot hold.     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     

6. Short Run average total cost (SAC)     

SAC $= \frac {short ~ run ~ total ~ costs}{total ~ output} = \frac {SC}{q}$     
<br/>
