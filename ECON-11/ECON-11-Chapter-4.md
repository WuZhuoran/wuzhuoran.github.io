# chapter 4, Utility maximazation and choices
1. determind all available choices (budgest constrain),
2. then choose the one we prefer.

## The Budget Constraint:
* set $x,y$ two goods, $p_x, p_y$ are the price of two goods, income I
$p_x x+ p_y yâ‰¤I$
1. when $x=0, p_y y = I,y= \frac{I}{p_y}$, vertical intersection.
2. when $y=0, p_x x = I,x= \frac{I}{p_x}$, horizontal intersection.
3. Connect the points then we get the bundles we can choose.
* $y= -\frac{p_x}{p_y} + \frac{I}{p_y}$, slope is negative.

> $x$ = champagng, $y$ duck, $p_x = $100, p_y$ = 20/lB

$-\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ = 100/20 = -5: one more champagng give up one pounf duck
