# Chapter 3 Preference and Utility

* how people make decisions.    

## Rational Choices

* Completeness:      
  - ‘‘A is preferred to B,’’     
  - ‘‘B is preferred to A,’’      
  - ‘‘A and B are equally attractive.’’     
* Transitivity:      
  - ‘‘A is preferred to B,  B is preferred to C, so A is preferred to C’’     
* Continuity:     
  - If ‘‘A is preferred to B’’, then situations suitably ‘‘close to’’ A must also be preferred to B     
<br/>

## Utility:     

* Axioms satisfied &rarr; utility function.      
* Utility ranks the desirability  of consumption, not the happiness , nor depend on people;     

Example:      

|A: 0.3 carat Dimond Ring  | B: 3 carat Dimond Ring|
|------------- | -------------|
|Let: $U(B) = 10,  U(A) = 5$ |      
|$U(B) = 20,  U(A) = 10$|  multiple by  2|
|$U(B) = 100,  U(A) = 2$| multiple by power of 2|
|$U(B) = 2.3,  U(A) = 1.6$| log|

**$\rightarrow\rightarrow$**  $U(B) > U(A)$ for most people. (the desire of B)     
**$\rightarrow\rightarrow$**   Imply a increasing function.     

## Trade and Substitution:
---
* **Indifference Curve** shows a set of consumption bundles among which the individual is indifferent.
* **Marginal rate of substitution**, **MRS**, the negative of the slope of the indifference curve at any point.      
  - measures individuels willingness to trade $y$ for $x$;     
  - MRS changes as $x$ and $y$ change.      

Example:

All $x$, $y$ such that $U(x, y) = K$;     
Total differential $U' = 0$;   
$d U = \frac {\partial L}{\partial x} +  \frac {\partial L}{\partial y} = 0$
