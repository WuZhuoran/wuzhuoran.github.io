# Chapter 3 Preference and Utility
how people make decisions.    

## Rational Choices
* Completeness:      
  - ‘‘A is preferred to B,’’     
  - ‘‘B is preferred to A,’’      
  - ‘‘A and B are equally attractive.’’     
* Transitivity:      
  - ‘‘A is preferred to B,  B is preferred to C, so A is preferred to C’’     
* Continuity:     
  - If ‘‘A is preferred to B’’, then situations suitably ‘‘close to’’ A must also be preferred to B     
<br/>

## Utility:     

* Axioms satisfied &rarr; utility function.      
* Utility ranks the desirability  of consumption, not the happiness , nor depend on people;     

Example:      

|A: 0.3 carat Dimond Ring  | B: 3 carat Dimond Ring|
|------------- | -------------|
|Let: $U(B) = 10,  U(A) = 5$ |      
|$U(B) = 20,  U(A) = 10$|  multiple by  2|
|$U(B) = 100,  U(A) = 2$| multiple by power of 2|
|$U(B) = 2.3,  U(A) = 1.6$| log|

&rarr; U(B) > U(A)$ for most people. (the desire of B)     

&rarr; Imply a increasing function.     

## Trade and Substitution:
* **Indifference Curve** shows a set of consumption bundles among which the individual is indifferent.
* **Marginal rate of substitution**, **MRS**, the negative of the slope of the indifference curve at any point.      
  - measures individuels willingness to trade $y$ for $x$;     
  - MRS changes as $x$ and $y$ change.      

Example:
All $x$, $y$ such that $U(x, y) = K$;  

Total differential $U' = 0$;   

$d U = \frac {\partial L}{\partial x} +  \frac {\partial L}{\partial y} = 0$   
<br/>

### indifference curves
### Transitivity
### Convexity     
* instead of consuming the extreme value, taking average of the two, &rarr; well balanced bundles are preferred.     
$αA+(1-α)b >A, 0<α<1$
line AB is higher utility than the indifference curve.

### Example of utility functions
![examples of utility functions](assets/ECON-11-Chapter-3-a1764.png)     
* **Cobb Douglas**:     
  * $U(x,y) = x^α v^β, α,β>0$, $U(x,y)=α*logx + β*logy$,     
  * MRS = $\frac{U_x}{U_y}$, where $U_x = \frac{α}{x}$,$U_y = \frac{β}{y}$     
  * Therefore **MRS $=\frac{α}{β}* \frac{y}{x}$**     

> $U(F,C,B)=6ln F + 2ln C + lnB$, and given: $P_F = 5, P_C = 20,P_B = 50, I =500$,     
&rarr; $5F+20C+50B=500$     
therefore, $L=6ln F + 2ln C + lnB + λ（500－5F－20C－50B)$     
$\frac{∂L}{∂F} = \frac{6}{F}=5λ$     
$\frac{∂L}{∂B} = \frac{1}{B}=50λ$     
$\frac{∂L}{∂C} = \frac{2}{C}=20λ$     
therefore:      
> $MRS_{B,F} = \frac{6}{F} * B = 5/50 = \frac{P_F}{P_B}$     
$MRS_{C,F} = \frac{6}{F} * \frac{C}{2} = 5/20 =\frac{P_F}{P_C}$      
$MRS_{C,B} = \frac{1}{B} * \frac{C}{2} = 50/20 =\frac{P_B}{P_C}$    
Tangent condition $MRS = \frac{U_x}{U_y} = \frac{P_x}{P_y}$      
(holds to many goods)

	<br/>       


* **Perfect substitutes**:
  * $U(x,y)=Ax+By$     
	infinity numbers of solution, fails convexity.
  * MRS is a constant: $MRS =\frac{A}{B}$, since $U_x = A, U_y = B$.     
	`no larganian can be applied`     
  * coins, bill, that substitutes with same rate.     
	<br/>     

* **Perfect Complements**:
* $U(x,y)=min(Ax,By)$.     
* The Angle gives the right combination, any other point does not change the utility.     
  * infinite - vertical slope: no use for extra goods;       
  * zero - horizontal slope: no need to give up the other goods for extra goods;     
  * slope at the angle point, may varies.     
		* Keep x constant, and increasing y does not increase utility. Increase both x, y will increase the utility.    
<br/>     

* **Constant Elasticity of substitution**:    
previous three are special cases of CES.     
$δ=1, 0, -∞$ .

### Homothetic Preference:
* MRS depends only on the ratio of the amount consumed of two goods.     
all indifference curves have the same shape
  * perfect substitution: MRS is same everywhere;
  * perfect complements MRS $=∞$     

> $U(x,y)=x + ln y$     
> Homothetic Preferences: MRS $=\frac{α}{β}\frac{y}{x}=e^{\frac{x}{y}}$     
> Non Homothetic Preferences: MRS = y

## The many good case:     
$U(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)$ = K, Constant
