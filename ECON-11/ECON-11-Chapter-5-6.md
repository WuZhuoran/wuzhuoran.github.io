# Chapter 5, Income and Substitution Effects

* Marshallian demands(consumption varies with price and income)
$x_1^* =g_1(p_1, p_2,..., p_n, I)$

* Hicksian Demands, (consumption varies with price and utility)
$x_1^* =h_1(p_1, p_2,..., p_n, U_-)$

## Changes in Income     

* Increase income &rarr;
budget constrain swifts out in parallel. higher levels of utility.

* $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ does not change, the MRS at a optimal will not change.

* The change in consumption caused by a small change in income can be computed using the Marshallian Demands(Uncompensated demands)
$g_x(p_x, p_y, l') - g_x(p_x, p_y, l)$

* inferior & normal:
- x and y are **normal** goods
$\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial I} ≥ 0$
when increasing income, choose to consume more x and y.

- x is an **inferior** goods
$\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial I} ≤ 0$
when increasing income, choose to consume less x and more y.     
<br/>

## Changes in a Good's price
Alters the slope of the budget constraint.

* $p_x$ change, cause $x$ change,
use Marshallian demand function for $x=g_x(p_x^, ,p_y, I) - g_x(p_x, p_y, I)$

* $p_x$ change, cause $y$ change,
use Marshallian demand function for $y=g_y(p_x^, ,p_y, I) - g_y(p_x, p_y, I)$

* Small changes in $p_x$, cause change in $x$,
use Marchallian demand function for $x=\frac{\partial g_x(p_x, p_y, I)}{\partial p_x} dp_x$

* Small changes in $p_x$, cause change in $y$,
use Marchallian demand function for $y=\frac{\partial g_y(p_x, p_y, I)}{\partial p_x} dp_x$


### Substitution Effect:
* A is always cheaper than B,
people choose to **buy cheaper things more.**
`insert substitution effect pic form ppt`

* substitution effect caused by a change in $p_x$ can be computed using the hicksian demand function:
$x=h_x(p_x^, ,p_y, U_-) - h_x(p_x, p_y, U_-)$

* caused by a small changes in $p_x$ , $x=\frac{\partial h_x(p_x, p_y, U_-)}{\partial p_x}$

### Income Effect
* When income does not change, and the price of A is dropped, **purchasing power increased,** achieve hight utility.
`insert pic form ppt`

* income effect caused by $p_x$ is the total change-substitution effect:
$g_x(p_x^, ,p_y, I) - g_x(p_x, p_y, I) - h_x(p_x^, ,p_y, U_-) - h_x(p_x, p_y, U_-)$

* caused by a small change in the price $p_x$ ia rhw difference between the total change and the substitution effect:
$\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_x}dp_x - \frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x}dp_x$


### Slutsky Equation for $x, y, p_x, p_y$:
1. we have $x^*=g_x(p_x, p_y, I)$, $x^*=h_x(p_x, p_y, U_-)$, and $E(p_x, p_y, U_-)=I$

2. We replace $I$ by Expenditure function: $g_x(p_x, p_y, I)=g_x(p_x, p_y, (E(p_x, p_y, U_-)) = h_x(p_x, p_y, U_-)$


3. Take partial derivatives of the function, we get: $\frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x}= \frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_x}+\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial E} \frac{\partial E}{\partial p_x}$, and because of $E=I$, we replace the E: $\frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x}= \frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_x}+\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial I} \frac{\partial E}{\partial p_x}$.


4. Since $E(p_x, p_y, U_-)=p_x x^x*, p_y y^*$, we get $\frac{\partial E}{\partial p_x}= x^*$ &rarr; (Envelop Theorem)


5. plug back in to the function $\frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x}= \frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_x}+\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial I} x^*$

6. $\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_x}=\frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x}-\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial I} x^*$, &rarr; **Slutsky Equation**,
where total effect = substitution effect - income effect.
<br/>

**Normal** goods: $\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_x}<= \frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x}$,

**Inferior** goods: $\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_x} > \frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x}$.
<br/>

**Example of a Cobb-Douglas Function**: $U(x,y) = x^{0.5}y^{0,5}$

$x^*=g_x(p_x, p_y, I)= \frac{0.5}{p_x}I$,

$x^*=h_x(p_x, p_y, U_-) = (\frac{p_y}{p_x})^{0.5}U_-$,

Total Effect:
$\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_x}=0.5 I(- \frac{1}{(p_x)^2})=-\frac{0.5}{p_x^2}I<0$

Substitution effect:
$\frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x} = -0.5 \frac{p_y^{0.5}}{p_x^{1.5}} U_- < 0$

$U_- = V(p_x, p_y, I)=\frac{I}{2p_x^{0.5} p_y^{0.5}}$ plug in to above equation, we get $\frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x} = -0.25 \frac{I}{p_x^2}$

Income effect: $- \frac{\partial g_x}{\partial I} x^* = -\frac{0.5}{p_x} \frac{0.5}{p_x} I = -0.25 \frac{0.5}{p_x^2}$

Therefore, Sluskey Equation: $-\frac{0.5}{p_x}I = -0.25 \frac{I}{p_x^2}- 0.25 \frac{I}{p_x^2}$
<br/>

## Prices changes for Normal goods:

* Normal Goods:
  - price falls, both effects lead to a rise in quantity demanded;
  - price rises, both effects lead to a drop in quantity demanded;

* Inferior Goods:
substitution and income effects move in opposite directions:
  - price falls, substitution rises quantity demanded, income move to opposite;
  - price rises, substitution drops quantity demanded, income move to opposite.

### Giffen's Paradox
increase in price generates increase in real income

inferior:  drop income = rise demanded

income effect greater than the substitution, consumption increase.

## Uncompensated & Compensated Curve

### Uncompensated Demand Curve
* Uncompensated demand curve for **good x** is the Marshallian demand function with fixed price of the other good and income: $x^* = g_x(p_x,p_{y-},I_-)$;

* Increase $p_x$:
  - lower indifference curve,
  - Nominal income is constant, but real income falls as price of x rises.

### Compensated Demand Curve
* Compensated Demand curve for **good x** is the Hicksian demand function with fixed price of the other good and utility level: $x^* = h_x(p_x,p_{y-},U_-)$;

`NOTE:` For **normal good**:
* compensated demand curve is less responsive of price changes than the uncompensated demand curve.
* the uncompensated demand curve reflects both income and substitution effects:
* compensated demand curve only reflect only substitution effects.     
<br/>     

## Demand Elasticities     
Since the size of partial derivatives depends on the unit we use to consume goods, it is hard to compare:     
(changing currency, lB-kg, apple in 1980s and apple today. )     

### Marshallian (Uncompensated) Demand Elasticities

* Income elasticity of demand $e_{x, I}=\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial I} \frac{I}{g_x}= \frac{\partial ln g_x}{\partial ln I}$,      
measures the percentage change in consumption of x in response to one percent change in income.

* Size of the elasticity:
  - $e_{x, I} > 0$, demand is normal;
  - $e_{x, I} < 0$, demand is inferior;
  - $e_{x, I} < 1$, the good is necessity;
  - $e_{x, I} > 1$, the goos is luxury.
<br/>

#### Own Price Elasticity of Demand:
* Own price elasticity of demand is **negative**, the only exceptions are the Giffen goods.

* $e_{x, p_x}=\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_x} \frac{P}{g_x}= \frac{\partial ln g_x}{\partial ln p_x}$     

* the size of the elasticity is important,
  - $e_{x, I} < -1$, demand is elastic.
  - $e_{x, I} > -1$, demand is inelastic.
  - $e_{x, I} = -1$, demand is unit elastic.

#### Cross price elasticity of demand
$e_{x, p_y}=\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_y} \frac{p_y}{g_x}= \frac{\partial ln g_x}{\partial ln p_y}$,

### Hicksian (Compensated) price elasticities
#### Compensated own price elasticity     
$e^c_{x, p_x} = \frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x} \frac{p_x}{h_x}= \frac{\partial ln h_x}{\partial p_x}$
#### cross-price elasticity     
$e^c_{x, p_y} = \frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_y} \frac{p_y}{h_x}= \frac{\partial ln h_x}{\partial p_y}$

### Slusky Equation
* Difference between hicksian and marshallian price elasticities:    
  - income elasticity;     
  - the share of income spent on the good.   
* hicksian and marshallian price elasticities will be similar if:
  - the income elasticity of x is small;     
  - the share of income devoted to x is small.     
<br/>     

* Slusky Equaiton: $\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_x}=\frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x}-\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial I} x^{* }$, multiply both sides by $\frac{p_x}{x^* }$,     

* $\frac {p_x}{x^* } \frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_x}=\frac {p_x}{x^* } \frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x} - \frac{p_x x^* }{x^* } \frac{\partial g_x}{\partial I} \frac{I}{x^* }$     

* if we set $s_x = \frac{p_x x^* }{I}$, then $e_{x, p_x} = e_{x, p_x}^c - s_x e_{x, I}$

<br/>

**Example:**

Known: $U(x,y)= x^\alpha y^\beta$, and $\alpha + \beta =1$

1. solve for marshallian $x^* = g_x(p_x, p_y, I)=\frac{\alpha}{p_x}I$,     
&rarr; $e_{x, p_x} = \frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_x} \frac{p_x}{g_x}= -\frac{\alpha I}{p_x(\frac{\alpha I}{p_x})} = -1$

2. Aanother way to solve: $ln x^* =ln g_x(p_x, p_y, I) = ln \alpha + lnI - ln p_x$

3. $e_{x, p_x} = \frac{\partial ln g_x}{\partial ln p_x} = -1$     
$e_{x, p_y} = 0$     
$e_{x, I} = \frac{\partial g_x}{\partial I} \frac{I}{g_x}=\frac{\alpha}{p_x}\frac{I}{g_x} = 1$

### Homogeneity, between demand elasticities, Euler's theorem (relations)
* Marshallian demand function are homogeneous of degree zero in all price and income;

#### The Euler's Theorem      
For homogeneous function implies that:  $0 = p_x \frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_x} + p_y \frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_y} + I \frac{\partial g_x}{\partial I}$

* Devide by $g_x$, we get $0= e_{x, p_x} + e_{x, p_y} +e_{x, I}$

* A 1 percentage change in all prices and income will leave the quantity demanded of x unchanged.

#### Engel Aggregation
* Income elasticity of demand for food items is less than one,
* Income elasticity of demand for non food items must be greater than one;

**Proof:**
$I$ = Expenditure $= p_x g_x(p_x, p_y, I) + p_y g_y(p_x, p_y, I)$
$1=p_x \frac{\partial g_x}{\partial I} + p_y \frac {\partial g_y}{\partial I}$
mutiply $\frac{g_x I}{g_x I}$ for each term:

$1= \frac{p_x g_x}{I} \frac{\partial g_x}{\partial I} + \frac{p_y g_y}{I} \frac {\partial g_y}{\partial I}$

$1= s_x e_{e, I} + s_y e_{y,I}$
$s_x=$ share on food, $s_y=1-s_x$

$ (1- s_x) e_{y,I} = 1- s_x e_{x,I} > 1-s_x $, since $e_{x,I} < 1$;
cancel out $(1- s_x)$, therefore, $e_{y,I} > 1$.

**Example**
check the relationships:
* Homogeneity: $0= e_{x, p_x} + e_{x, p_y} + e_{x, I}$,
since: $e_{x, p_x} = -1,  e_{x, p_y} = 0$

* Engel aggregation: $1= s_x e_{e, I} + s_y e_{y,I}$,
$s_x= \frac{p_x x^* }{I}= \frac{p_x \frac{\alpha I}{p_x}}{I}= \alpha$
$s_y= \frac{p_y y^* }{I}= \beta$
$e_{x, I} = e_{y, I}=1$,
$\alpha * 1+ \beta * 1 =  \alpha + \beta  =  1$     

### Slusky equation in elasticity form:
$e_{x, p_x}= e^c_{x, p_x} -s_x e_{x,I}$
&rarr; $e^c_{x, p_x} = e_{x, p_x} + s_x e_{x,I}$
$e^c_{x, p_x} = -1 + \alpha * 1 = \alpha -1 = - \beta$     
<br/>      


## Consumer Welfare
* Price increase from $p^0 _ x$ to $p^ 1 _ x$, to compare the expenditure for a given level of utility $U_-$.
* if $p^1 _ x > p^0 _ x$,then $E(p^1 _x, p_y, U_-)>E(p^0 _x, p_y, U_-)$
* The difference is called **compensating variation (CV)**.

* the increase in income that the individual would need to achieve $U_1$.
point B and C have same slope:
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     


* compensate the consumer to stay at the same indifference curve.

`One last result`:     
derivative of the expenditure function with respect to $p_x$ is the compensated demand function

$\frac {\partial E}{p_x} = h_x$

## Substitutes and Complements
* Substitute: One can replace the other in use.  `coffee&tea, butter&cream`
* Complement: Used together.  `coffee&cream`     

### Gross Substitutes and Complements:     
$p_y$falls, $y=-\frac{p_x}{p_y}x+\frac{I}{p_y}$      

* goods *x* and *y* are **gross substitutes** if $\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_y} > 0$     
$p_y$ increases, then consume more x;         

<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     


* goods *x* and *y* are **gross Complements** if $\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_y} < 0$     
$p_y$ increases, then consume less x;     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     




### Mathematical Treatment     

the change in $x$ caused by a change in $p_y$, use Slutsky-type equation:     

$\frac{\partial g_x}{\partial p_y}=\frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_y} - \frac{\partial g_x}{\partial I}y$     

<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     


## Asymmetry of the Gross definitions     

* Gross substitutes and gross complements are not symmetric     

* It is possible
  - for x to be a substitute for y
  - at same time for y to be a complement of x.     

* This occurs when the income effect dominates the substitution effect for one good but not for the other.     

**Example:**     
$U(x,y) = lnx+y$     
solve the utility maximization, we get $y^* = \frac{(I-p_x)}{p_y}$, $x^* = \frac{p_y}{p_x}$     
therefore, $\frac{\partial x^* }{\partial p_y} > 0, \frac{\partial y^* }{\partial p_x} = 0$     
<br/>     

### Net Substitutes and Complement:
`focus solely on substitution effect`     

* **net substitutes** if $\frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x}>0$    

* **net complement** if $\frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x}<0$

* This definition is unambiguous because $\frac{\partial h_i}{\partial p_j}=\frac{\partial h_j}{\partial p_i}$, since $h_i (p_1,..., p_n,U_-)=\frac{\partial E(p_1, p.., p_2, U_-)}{\partial p_i}$     
<br/>     

**Example: Gross Complements but Net substitutes**     
$p_y$ falls,      
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>     


## Substitutability with many goods      

* "most" goods are net substitutes.     

**proof:**
1. Start with Hicksian demand function $x_i = h_i(p_1, ..., p_n, U_-)$, homogeneous of degree zero in prices.     

2. The Euler's theorem yields $0= p_1 \frac{\partial h_i}{p_1} + ... p_i \frac{\partial h_i}{p_i}+...+ p_n \frac{\partial h_i}{p_n}$      

3.Divide by $h^i$, same compensated elasticities $e^c_{i1}+...e^c_{ii}+...e^c_{in}=0$     

4. Since the negativity of Substitution effect that $e^c_{ii}<0$,      
$∑_{i≠j} e^c_{ij} = - e^c_{ii}≥0$
<br/>
