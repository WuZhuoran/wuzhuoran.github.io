# Data Source

## According to the requirements, our project is created to answer a data science question. It must include two data sets from different sources for  both descriptive and predictive data analysis.

## Furthermore, we expected these two data sets can be combined later for prescriptive analysis, which means we expected to be able to find possible relationship between the two data sets and to discover any useful information to answer the data science question.

## We are interested in finding the connection between house price and regional economy/demography. We decided to collect data from [Zillow.com](https://www.zillow.com) and [OpenDataNetwork.com](https://www.opendatanetwork.com/) for house data and eco/demo data respectively. Zillow is a famous online real estate database company that has data on 110 million homes across the United States.

## In addition to giving value estimates, it also provides basic information on a given home, such as square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. As for the eco/demo data, there are multiple public data platforms. We chose Open Data Network as the major data source because the website is user-friendly while it provides multiple applicable tools to collect data for different categories.
