# Data collection

## Instead of downloading a data set file directly, we were asked to create python scripts using APIs to collect data from the two aforementioned websites.

# Zillow Data

## Zillow API provides various information about one property. We will collect house information from three perspectives:

## 1) House Location Information.
## 2) House Detail Information
## 3) House Quality Information.

## In this part, we will collect more than 40000 houses in the area of Los Angeles county.

# Economic and Social Data

## For Open Data Network API, we gathered 5 categories of data including GDP per capita for each metropolitan, crime rate per 100k people for each city, crime count for each city, graduation rate for each city and earning information for each city.

## According to the requirements, each data set must contain at least 20k examples and 12 attributes. Please see our report for detailed data set information.
