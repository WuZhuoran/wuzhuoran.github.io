# Introduction

## As a common sense, **house price** is an significant indicator to a city’s **economic development**. Meanwhile, the city’s **demographic factors** may affect the house price as well. `Mankiw and Weil (1988, 12)` presented their studies of the effect of economic changes (e.g., in population, employment, and income) on house prices.

## `Later, Clapp, J. M., & Giaccotto, C. (1994, 09)` studied on how to explore the relationship between methods used to measure house price indices and economic determinants of house prices at the local level.

## To argue a forecasting result based on a serious misinterpretation of Mankiw-Weil demand variable, `Swan, C. (1995, 02)` reinterpreted the Mankiw-Weil demand variable and suggested on considering more economic and demographic features as important factors on forecasts of house price.

## Our project is motivated by the study presented in Determinants of Real House Prices (NBER Working Paper No. 9262). The authors `D. Capozza, P. Hendershott, C. Mack, and C. Mayer (2002)` use data for 62 U.S. metropolitan areas with economic and demographic variables from 1979 to 1995 to explore two explanations for momentum and cyclical behavior: information-based explanations and supply-based theories. They find that both information dissemination and supply factors influence the dynamics of house prices.

## There are many studies focusing on the effect from other factors, such as `Gallin, J. (2003)` studied the relationship between house prices and income, `Bajari, P., Benkard, C. L., & Krainer, J. (2003, 06)` presented the study on house prices and consumer welfare, `Lutz, B. F. (2008, 09)` studied the connection between house price appreciation and property tax.

## In a person’s life, buying a house is almost inevitable and, sometimes, this could change his/her future permanently. Since it is difficult and challenging, assessing the real estate market requires well designed data analytic methods. The goal of our project is not only to build a machine learning model to predict a house’s price, but also to find out whether a city would be a good place for real estate investment by comparing the house price with the city’s economic and demographic data.
